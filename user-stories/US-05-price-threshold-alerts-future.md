## Description

One-shot alerts that fire when a price crosses a specific target in a given direction.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to set an alert when BTC crosses above $100,000 so I get notified the moment it happens
- As a user, I want to set an alert when ETH drops below $2,000 so I can buy the dip
- As a user, I want threshold alerts to fire once and deactivate, so I don't get spammed after the price crosses

## Status

Future — not included in current implementation phases.
