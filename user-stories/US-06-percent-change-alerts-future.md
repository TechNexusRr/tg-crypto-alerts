## Description

Alerts that fire when a symbol moves by a percentage threshold within a rolling time window.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be alerted when ETH moves 5% in the last 60 minutes so I can react to sudden volatility
- As a user, I want percent change alerts to repeat (with a cooldown) so I stay informed during extended moves

## Status

Future — not included in current implementation phases. Requires `priceSnapshots` table.
