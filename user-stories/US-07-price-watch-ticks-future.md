## Description

Passive price monitoring — the bot sends the current price of a symbol at a recurring interval.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to watch BTC and receive its price every 5 minutes so I can track it passively
- As a user, I want to stop watching a symbol at any time with a single command

## Status

Future — not included in current implementation phases.
